# Hotel-Transylvania

This hotel transylvania was code for my Object Oriented Programming class. This project uses a base monster class, which all other monsters inherit from. Additionally, I am implementing interfaces with each monster. A monster can possibly have a fly ability, strength ability, bite abiilty, or slime abiility which are all implemented using interfaces.

This code allows a monster to book a reservation for a specific day and for a specific duration.
